Run 'make' 

then in order to render a scene:

in the scene.json (or any json) file change the render mode to either: binary, phong or pathtracer

then run the following command in the terminal to render a scene
./bin/raytracer --spp 50 scenes/scene.json scene_phong.ppm

NOTE: the "--spp 50" here represents 50 samples per pixel. This can be changed accordingly.

Other examples could include: 
./bin/raytracer --spp 50 scenes/binary_primitives.json binary_primitives.ppm
./bin/raytracer --spp 50 scenes/mirror_image.json mirror_image.ppm
./bin/raytracer --spp 10000 scenes/brdf/scene.json scene_brdf.ppm
